		<h2><a name="information-we-collect-about-you" class="anchor"></a> 3. INFORMATION WE COLLECT <span class="nowrap">ABOUT YOU</span></h2>
		<p>3.1 We will collect and process the following data about you:</p>
		<ol type="a">
			<li> Information you give us "Submitted Information": This is information you give us about you by filling in forms on the App and/or the Site, or by corresponding with us (for example, by e-mail or via the chat functions on the App and/or the Site).

If you contact us, we will keep a record of that correspondence. The information you give us may include your name, address, date of birth, e-mail address, phone number, the Device's phone number, username, password and other registration information, financial, details of your bank account including the bank account number, bank sort code, IBAN, details of your debit and credit cards including the long number, relevant expiry dates and CVC, identification document numbers, copies of identification documents (for example, passport, driving licence and utility bill) personal description and photograph and any other information you provide us in order to prove your eligibility to use our services.</li>
			<li>Information we collect about you and your device. Each time you visit the App or our Site we will automatically collect the following information:

					<li>technical information, including the internet protocol (IP) address used to connect your computer to the Internet, your login information, browser type and version, time zone setting, browser plug-in types and versions, operating system and platform, device information and the type of mobile device you use, a unique device identifier (for example, your Device's IMEI number, the MAC address of the Device's wireless network interface, or the mobile phone number used by the Device), mobile network information, your mobile operating system, the type of mobile browser you use, time zone setting "Device Information";</li>
					<li>information about your visit, including the full uniform resource locators (URL), clickstream to, through and from our site (including date and time), services you viewed or searched for, page response times, download errors, length of visits to certain pages, page interaction information (such as scrolling, clicks, and mouse-overs), methods used to browse away from the page, device information;</li>

				</ol>
			</li>

This is used to prevent fraud, for instance if your mobile phone is saying that you are based in the UK, but your card is being used to enter into an ATM Withdrawal or point of sale purchase in Spain, we may not allow that transaction to be processed. Our card protection and fraud-prevention measures require this personal data for the feature to work. If you wish to use the particular feature, you will be asked to consent to your data being used for this purpose. You can withdraw your consent at any time by disabling location permission for the Amaiz App within your device settings "Location Information".</li>

These third parties are business partners (such as those we partner with to offer additional Amaiz Services like credit), sub-contractors in technical, payment and delivery services, advertising networks, analytics providers, search information providers, credit reference agencies, fraud prevention agencies, customer service providers and developers. Information we may collect about you from such parties can include credit search information, information which helps us to verify your identity or information relating to your payment transactions. Please see the 'Disclosure of your Information' section for more information.</li>
			<li> If you allow us to, we will collect friends lists from Facebook and similar information from other third parties such as Twitter and Google – the App will periodically re-collect this information in order to stay up-to-date</li>

			<li>Third Party Information: We will combine this information with information you give to us and information we collect about you. We will use this information and the combined information:

					<li>for the purposes set out above (depending on the types of information we receive).</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ol>
		<p>4.3 We may associate any category of information with any other category of information and will treat the combined information as personal data in accordance with this policy for as long as it is combined.</p>
		<p>For example, we may use credit reference agencies to carry out credit searches on you, so that, when you apply for credit products or when we suggest credit products to you via the Amaiz App, we will be able to tailor our credit offering to your needs. The use of credit reference agencies and fraud prevention agencies is not limited to such agencies based in the United Kingdom and includes such agencies overseas. Any such search under this section may leave a footprint on your credit file. You acknowledge that we may carry out such credit search in the knowledge that it may leave a footprint on your credit history. We do not allow joint account holders, however in certain circumstances credit reference agencies may link your record with your spouse, partner or other financial associate. In certain circumstances, you are entitled to access your personal records held by credit and fraud prevention agencies. If you would like details of the credit reference and fraud prevention agencies from which we have obtained or may obtain information about you, please contact us via in-App support. You can withdraw your consent to be credit searched at any time by contacting a member of our support team via our in-App chat function.</p>
		<p>4.4 If we decide to engage advertisers to promote our products and services, the advertisers and their advertising networks may require anonymised personal data to serve relevant adverts to you and others. We will never disclose identifiable information about individuals to advertisers, but we may provide them with aggregate information about our users (for example, we may inform them that 700 men aged under 28 have clicked on their advertisement on any given day). We may also use such aggregate information to help our advertising partners provide a tailored and targeted campaign, relevant for a sub-section of our users (for example, women in Manchester). In some instances, we may use personal data we have collected from you to enable our advertising partners to display their advertisement to their target audience.</p>
		<h3>Purposes for which we will use your personal data</h3>
		<p>4.5 We have set out below, in a table format, a description of all the ways we use your personal data as stated above, and which of the legal bases we rely on to do so. We have also identified what our legitimate interests are where appropriate.</p>

		<p>8.1 Amaiz is obligated under the Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing and Transfer of Funds (Information on the Payer) Regulations 2017 (SI 2017/692) to retain personal data about you and your Amaiz Transactions for a period of five years form the last transaction or end of the business relationship. Also, as an FCA authorised e-money institution, we are under further regulatory obligations to retain your data for a certain amount of time. Under the E-Money Regulations 2011 you have the right to redeem your e-money up to six years after termination of your Amaiz Account. We therefore use this retention requirement as a benchmark for all personal data that we receive from you. To not hold your information for longer than is strictly necessary we will not hold any of your personal data for more than 6 years after the termination of our business relationship. Although we reserve the right to hold your personal data for longer if we are compelled to by a regulatory body or law enforcement agency.</p>
		<h2><a name="your-legal-rights" class="anchor"></a> 9. YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS</h2>
		<p>You have rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data. Please see below to find out more about these rights:</p>
		<p>You have the right to:</p>
		<p>Request access to your personal data (commonly known as a "data subject access request"). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you. If you require this, then please reach out to our support team via <a href="mailto:team@amaiz.com">team@amaiz.com</a>.</p>
		<p>Request correction of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us. If you require this, then please reach out to our support team via <a href="mailto:team@amaiz.com">team@amaiz.com</a>.</p>
		<p>Request erasure of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request. As an FCA authorised firm, Amaiz is under certain obligations to retain certain data for a minimum of 6 years (see above). Please note that these retention requirements supersede any right to erasure requests under applicable data protection laws.</p>
		<p>Object to processing of your personal data. This is in situations where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights. As an FCA authorised firm, Amaiz is	16 under certain obligations to process and retain certain data for compliance purposes. Please note that these requirements supersede any right to objection requests under applicable data protection laws. If you object to the processing of certain data, then we may not be able to provide the Amaiz Services and it is likely we will have to terminate your account.</p>
		<p>Request restriction of processing of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios:</p>
		<ol type="a">
			<li>if you want us to establish the data's accuracy;</li>
			<li>where our use of the data is unlawful, but you do not want us to erase it;</li>
			<li>where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or</li>
			<li>you have objected to our use of your data, but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it. Please note that any requests in relation to the restriction of the processing of your data means that we may not be able to perform the contract we have or are trying to enter into with you (including the Amaiz Services). In this case, we may have to cancel your use of the Amaiz Services, but we will notify you if this is the case at the time.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>Request the transfer of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format, which you can then transfer to an applicable third party. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you. If you require this then please reach out to our support team via the <a href="mailto:team@amaiz.com">team@amaiz.com</a>.</p>
		<p>Withdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide the Amaiz Services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.</p>
		<h3>No fee usually required</h3>
		<p>You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.</p>
		<h3>What we may need from you</h3>
		<p>We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.</p>
		<h3>Time limit to respond</h3>
		<p>We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.</p>
		<h3>If you fail to provide personal data</h3>
		<p>Where we need to collect personal data by law, or under the terms of a contract we have with you and you fail to provide that data when requested, we may not be able to perform the contract we have or are trying to enter into with you (including the Amaiz Services). In this case, we may have to cancel your use of the Amaiz Services but we will notify you if this is the case at the time.</p>
